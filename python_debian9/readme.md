This is an image based on debian 9 for python project.

It contains the python lib for protobuf with c++ extension since it wasn't possible to build it without using the source.
uwsgi is also included for convenience.
Issuing a debian 9 python image allows for the use of more recent TLS protocols up to TLSv1.2 (limited to SSLv3 on debian 8).
